							Types of Languages
				=========================================================
=>In Industry , we have Two Types of Programming Langauges. They are
			1. Un-Structured Programming Languages.
			2. Structured Programming Languages.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Un-Structured Programming Languages
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>The Un-Structured Programming Languages DOES NOT CONTAIN FUNCTIONs Concept. So that whose related Applications has the Following Limitations.

		1. Application Development time is More
		2. Application Memory Space is More
		3. Application Execution Time is More
		4. Application Performnace is Degraded
		5. Redundency(Duplication or Replication)  of the Code is More
Examples: GW-BASIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Structured Programming Languages.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>The Structured Programming Languages  CONTAINS FUNCTIONs Concept. So that whose related Applications has the Following Advatnages.
		1. Application Development time is Less.
		2. Application Memory Space is Less.
		3. Application Execution Time is Less.
		4. Application Performance is Enhanced (Improved)
		5. Redundency(Duplication or Replication)  of the Code is Minimized.
Examples:  C, C++, Java, C#.net, PYTHON...etc
