				 Introduction to Object Oriented  Principles or Features or Concepts 
			======================================================================
=>In Real Time, to develop any project, we need to choose a Language.
=>The Language, which we select for developing the Project can satisfy Two Types of Principles. They are
	
			1. Procedure OR Functional Oriented Principles
			2. Object Oriented Principles
=>In Otherwords, In Industry, we have Two Types of Programming Languages. They are

			1. Procedure OR Functional Oriented Programming Languages.
			2. Object Oriented  Programming Languages.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Procedure OR Functional Oriented Programming Languages:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>If Programming Language satisfies Procedure OR Functional Oriented Principles then that Languages are called Procedure OR Functional Oriented Programming Language.
=>Examples:  C , Pascal,COBOL,PYTHON,upto Oracle7.3...etc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Object Oriented  Programming Languages
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>If Programming Language satisfies  Object Oriented   Principles then that Languages are called Object Oriented  Programming Language.
=>Examples:  Lisp,Small Talk,Ruby,C++,Java,C#.net, PYTHON,from Oracle 8 onwards...etc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>Even though PYTHON Belongs to Both Functional and Object Oriented  Programming Language, Internally Every Thing tretaed as Object.

		*********************************************************************************
				Every Thing in Python is an object--Advantages
							(OR)
					Advantages of OOPs
		*********************************************************************************
		1. It Stores Unlimited amount Data.
		2. The large of Volume of Data Transfered between Multiple Remote Machines all at once and gets Effective 
		     Communication.
		3. The confidential Data Transfered between Multiple Remote Machines in the form of Cipher Text. So that 
		    Security Enhanced (improved)
		4. The Data always available around the objects and gives Less Memory
		5. We can Bulild High end Re-Usable Applications by using Inheritance
