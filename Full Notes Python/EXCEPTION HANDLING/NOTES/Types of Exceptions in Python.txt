						Types of Exceptions in Python
				=======================================================
=>In Python Programming, we have 2 Types of Exceptions. They are

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Pre-Defined OR Built-In Exceptions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>Pre-Defined OR Built-In Exceptions are those which are already developed by Python Language Developers and available in Python Software and They are used by Python Lang Programmers for Dealing with Universal Problems.
=>Some of the Universal Problems are
			i) Invalid Index ( IndexError )
			ii) Invalid Conversions ( ValueError)
			iii) Invalid Number of Arguments OR Operations (TypeError )
			iv) Passing Invalid Key (KeyError)
			v) Division by zero problems (ZeroDivisionError:) .........etc
=>All Previous Error Names are called Runtime Errors  and They are called Pre-Defined Exception Class Names.

2. Programmer OR User OR Custom Defined Exceptions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>Programmer OR User OR Custom Defined Exceptions are those which are developed by Python Programmers and they are available in Python Project and They are used by  Other Team Members of Same Project and They are always deals with Common Problems occuring in the project.
