					Introduction to Network Programming OR Socket Programming
								( socket module )
				=============================================================
=>The purpose of Network Programming OR Socket Programming is that "To Share the Data Between Multiple Devices which are located either in Same Network or Different Network".
=>To Share the Data Between Multiple Devices which are located either in Same Network or Different Network, there must exist physical Establishment of Network.
-------------------------------------------------
Definition of Network
-------------------------------------------------
=>A Network is Collection of Autonomous Inter-Connected Computers Connected  with Server.
-------------------------------------------------
=>To do Network Programming OR Socket Programming, there must exist physical Establishment of Network.
=>In Network Programming OR Socket Programming, we develop Two Types of Programs. They are

					1. Server Side Program
					2. Client Side Program
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition of Server Side Program
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
=>A Server Side Program is one, which is always Receive the Request from Client Side Program, Process the Request and Gives Response Back to Client Side Program.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition of Client Side Program
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
=>A Client Side Program is one, which is always makes a Request to Server Side Program and Obtains the Response from Server Side Program.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition of DNS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
=>DNS stands for Domain Naming System/Service. 
=>DNS Represents Name of the Physical machine where Server Side Program Resides
=>The Default DNS of Every Computer is "localhost".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition of IP Address
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
=>IP Address stands for Internet Protocol Address.
=>IP Address Represents Physical Address of the Machine where Server Side Program Resides.
=> The Default IPAddress of Every Computer is 127.0.0.1 (Loop Back Address).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition of PortNo
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
=>A Port Number is one of the Logical Numerical ID where the Server Side Program is Running
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hence Every Server Side Program Must be available at Certain (DNS/IPAddress, PortNumber)
