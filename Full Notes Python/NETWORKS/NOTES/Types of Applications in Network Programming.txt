				=======================================================
						Types of Applications in Network Programming
				=======================================================
=>In Network Programming, we develop Two Types of Programs. They are
						1. Server Side Program
						2. Client Side Program
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps for Developing  Server Side Programs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step-1: import socket and other modules if Required
Step-2: Create an Object of socket at Server Side Program called Server Socket.
Step-3: Every Server Side Program(Server Socket) Must BIND with Certain DNS/IP Address  and Port Number.
Step-4: Every Server Side Program(Server Socket)  must be CONFIGURED in such way that to How Many Client Side 
              Program It can Communicate.
Step-5: Every Server Side Program(Server Socket)  must be ACCEPT the Request of Client Side Program (Client Socket)
Step-6: Every Server Side Program(Server Socket)  must be READ Request of Client Side Program, PROCESS and Gives 
              RESPONSE back to Client Side Program.
Step-7:  Repeat Step-5 and Step-6 Until All Requests of Client Side Program Completed.

Steps for Developing  Client Side Programs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step-1: import socket and other modules if Required
Step-2: Create an Object of socket at Client Side Program called Client Socket.
Step-3: Every Client Side Program (Client Socket) Must get CONNECTION from Server Side Program by passing ( DNS/IP 
              Address,Port Number)
Step-4: Every Client Side Program (Client Socket) Must make Request to the Server Side Program (Server Socket)
Step-5: Every Client Side Program (Client Socket) Must Receive the Response from Server Side Program (Server Socket).
Step-6: Repeat Step-4 and Step-5 Until All Requests of Client Side Program Completed.
